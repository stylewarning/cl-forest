;;; This file demonstrates how to use the Rigetti Forest API
;;; (http://forest.rigetti.com) by exposing the two most important
;;; functions: RUN and WAVEFUNCTION. Other, more advanced functions
;;; are supported by the API as well, but are not implemented
;;; here. This file is intended to be pedagogical and not production
;;; quality.
;;;
;;; The logic mostly follows the `forest` module of the open source
;;; library pyQuil, officially supported by Rigetti.
